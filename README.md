# GammaRadiationDetection
Distinguish between signal and background gamma radiation

This is a classification model to determine the difference between signal radiation and background radiation detected by the magic telescope.  The public dataset can be found here:

I used google colab to process the data.

This is a pretty simple problem but one neat part of the code is trying multiple classification models to determine which performs the best.
